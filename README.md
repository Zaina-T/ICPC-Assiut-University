#ICPC Assiut University Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to problems from the ICPC Assiut University Training platform. Each solution demonstrates my approach to different types of competitive programming challenges, organized by problem topic or ID.


## Structure
- **Folders/Files**: Each problem is placed in a separate file or folder named according to the problem's title or ID.
- **Language**: The solutions are implemented in C++ (or specify other languages, if any).

 **Problem Categories**
  - Arrays
  - Loops
  - Recursion
  - Sorting
  - Functions
  - Math

## How to Use
You can review any solution by navigating to the corresponding file. It is possible for a single problem to have multiple solutions, and each solution will be stored in a separate file within the problem's folder. 

Each file includes:
1. The approach and thought process behind the solution.
2. The C++ code for the solution.
3. A single problem may contain multiple solutions, so different solutions will be provided in separate files.

## Getting Started
To get started with these solutions, you can clone the repository and explore the solutions on your local machine.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/g-mshvidobadze/ICPC-Assiut-University.git
   
2. Navigate to a specific problem folder to review the solution files.
3. Compile and run the C++ code using your preferred compiler.
